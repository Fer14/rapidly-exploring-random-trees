## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fer14/rapidly-exploring-random-trees
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd rapidly-exploring-random-trees
``````

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python rrt.py
```

## Simplified version

Aditionally there is a simplified version of the rrt algorithm that looks like this:
